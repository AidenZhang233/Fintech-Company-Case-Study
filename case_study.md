## Recommendations

J.P. Morgan is doing a great job in its diversified market. Recently J.P. Morgan just applied patent for its financial consulting AI called Index GPT. Therefore, instead of suggesting a new product, I would only recommend leaders of J.P. Morgan taking AI-technologies carefully because nowadays except the fact that AI has brought us groundbreaking changes in various industries, researchers still have a long way to validate principals behind artificial intelligence, it would be not wise to apply something not yet mathematically proved to the real-world business. Besides, in recent years, researchers also discovered several critical defects of models trained through machine learning and deep neural network which could lead to serious security issues.
